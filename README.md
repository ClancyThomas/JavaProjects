    <tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Project Description
        <td>Program creates bank accounts for an amount of people that the user specifies, and then it does a simulation of who ends up with all the money after people randomly meet each other and give a random amount of money based on who wins a coin flip. The user enters how many simulations the program will perform.
